# Movie Analysis

## Project Overview

The MovieAnalysis project involves gathering data from APIs and webscraping. After the data was gathered, exploratory data analysis was used to generate insights for making recommendations for the new Microsoft Movies team. 

### Data

#### Movie datasets are collected from:
  * IMDB website with Beautiful Soup
  * https://www.themoviedb.org/ with API call

#### The visuals were provided by manipulating the following variables:
  * Genres
  * Gross Revenues
  * Release Month
  * IMDB Ratings
  * TMDB Popularity
  * Runtime
